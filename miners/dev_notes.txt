Note on miners:

-AMD cannot be broken up into groups. There are miners that are unable to specify devices to do so.

-NVIDIA can have up to three device groups: -Type NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2,NVIDIA3 in case you have different
 model gpus. Be sure to use the corresponding -GPUDevices1 -GPUDevices2 -GPUDevices3 and -Wallet1
 -Wallet2 -Wallet3 arguments, or they will fail.

-Stak_Cpu cannot specify threads, if you use it, it will use ALL cpu threads. This may cause computer
 to lock up.
