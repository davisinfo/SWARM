ChangeLog

1.2.9:

(ALL VERSIONS)
-Added New Zergpool Equihash Algos


(HIVEOS)
-Added 'active' command
 Type 'active' to view active miners in any terminal
-Add 'stats' command
 Type 'stats to view MM.Hash miner stats in any terminal
-Created Help Files Folder
-Log Integration with HiveOS
 Logs are now scheduled to HiveOS logging.
-Added Pools To Main Mining Screen
-Added Previous HashRates To Main Mining Screen
-Cleaned up Main Mining Screen
-Repaired Random Failures Of EWBF Hive Stats

-Added -Benchmark Parameter. Expiremental:

  -Benchmark [seconds]

   If miner hashrate equals $null, -interval time will
change to -Benchmark time. This only works for NVIDIA1.
Other device groups will still mine as usual, but will
have same interval as -Benchmark.

   I did not test fully. Report if it is working correctly
I will update wiki.



1.3.0:

(Windows & HiveOS)

-Zergpool https:/. Better API calls.
-Added Equihash Algorithms - zergpool and mph

(HiveOS)
-Ensured -Benchmark parameter working
-Fixed -Timeouts parameter
-Log rollover every 12 hours. Miner divides logs into 1 hour periods.
-PID read/write for better process control
-Discovered actual Powershell Core bug in (where).count -eq 0. It worked when it wanted to. 
Reported to powershell, and then built workaround.
-Added Cuda-9-2 folder, will start filling with miner files for HiveOS cuda 9.2.
You must setup hiveOS to be able to use Cuda9.2 (Not reccommended)
-Added 10 second wait to give Miners time to spool up. Was noticing occasional lockup becuase
of too high resource use.
-Reduced hashrate display time to every 7 seconds instead of 5 for smoother display.
-Fixed Claymore API. However, noticed Claymore itself was displaying only 1 fan and 1 temp
during my testing occasionally. In future I will attempt to force defaults from Hive when this happens.
-Timeout Folder to notify when miners timeout. However, Timeouts no longer set all hashrates to zero. This
way miner can continue to try to mine that algo/coin. I simply reduces overall daily hashrate. The Timeout
folder will give you an idea of specific stats you may want to delete and then re-benchmark for fine tuning.
-Resolved Status flag issues. When typing "active", you should receive correct data.
-Resolved previous hashrate issues on screen
-Attempted to display better countdown times. NOTE: Internal countdown time varies by processor to processor.
However- Run time displayed for Miners is 100% correct.

1.3.2:

Truncate log stats for T-Rex, so user will know when miner isn't hashing in case MM.Hash fails
Attempted to fix multiple LogData screens
Migrated total t-rex log hash into try/catch argument to prevent on-screen errors (which is normal if hashrate isn't there).
Updated Miners
Migrated into a version setup, with remote upgrading capability- Details on full operation coming soon. (expiremental)
-Force paramter to clear T-Rex log.
updated Z-Enemy
updated T-Rex
Removed -Algorithms, as it was depreciated. Algorithms can now be changed by editing "Algorithms.txt" file
miner will self-install powershell
Added Date to stats command
Updated Help Files
Ensured All Miners Display Pool

1.3.3:

zergpool api updated.
for future implementation- zergpool_coin added
for future implementation- zerpgool_algo added
zergpool removed
blockmasters added (was not tested- Trying to push fast to fix zergpool)
starpool added (tested)
New command- "logdata" lets you see the stats recording miners that work from logs. Debug aid.
New command- "pidinfo" was always running in background- brought it to a screen so you can see MM.Hash process tracking. Debug aid.
LogData screen opens with every miner, is put to sleep if not needed (to preveny zombie app errors)
PIDInfo screens opens with every miner- Has always been running, it is just now visual
PIDInfo is now tracking MM.Hash process- For future implementation.
Added "clear" background process, work the same as miners- Double close command in case of hangs.
Small implementation to reduce resources.
Status flags written to disk, to provide double checking of MM.Hash states and its miners.

1.3.4:
-HiveOS Added hive integrated "mine" command. Enter to bring up NVIDIA1 screen (mining window).
-Added -No_Algo argument. -No_Algo excludes aglorithm of your choice. Must match Algorithms.txt.
Case Sensitive! (All lower case characters)
-EWBF coins added back in. Updated equihash to match zergpool.
-Reduced resources on PID system/tracking, removed read/write status- It was redundant.
-Newer streamlined benchmarking system. (Both versions)
-Better chance of miner catching and recording timeouts.
-Recorded hashrate displayed at benchmarking. Recorded hashrate is pulled from file (accurate).
-Enemy 1.15a
-CryptoDredge 0.8.3
-Started staging of much faster -Auto_Coin version. Not implemented yet.
-Started staging for T-Rex API Rest method hashrate recording (when implemented).


1.3.7 HiveOS Silver Lambo Edition:
-IMPROVED COIN MINING SYSTEM! Highly recommend to try -Auto-Coin "Yes"
-MM.Hash will not sort or download entire database, miner first sorts by most profitable algorithms, if the best pool is pool that has the capability of selecting a coin other than BTC: IT then chooses the coins of the algorithms of that pool.
-Stats will show coin list of a particular algorithm if coin mining occurs during that period.
- -Auto Coin switching is now around a 20-30 second process: which is 200% better.
-Fixed Powershell Core update bugs with a better workarounds.
-MM.Hash in background checks stats for possible timeouts, for accurate timeouts.
-MM.Hash now closes itself and all background windows within a few seconds of it stopping.
-Added -threshold argument default (internally) is set to .1 - If profit day shows to be .1 btc: MM.Hash ignores algo.
-Added back & improved active times for miners.
-Staged miners.txt. Does not work. However, you can see the direction it is going.
-This is beta version of new system.
-CPU Miners will now compile to your system. I included an experimental one that can work for ARM cpus. Note- Initial benchmark period is usually long for cpuminers. I would turn up -interval when benchmarking them. After initial benchmarks, you can set -interval to a much lower setting.
-hex added to algorithms.txt and files.
-fixed blockmasters pool file.
-fixed starpool pool file.
-pools initial stats are now estimate current. 24 hours was causing irregular initial stats. Improved 'stats' command and display.
-Enemy 1.16 added
-Code Staging for AMD

1.3.8
Important: -GPU_Count1 argument was removed. Miner now detects GPU's. You will get errors if used.
-Upated Windows Version To New Coin Switching System (Windows Miner Down- Could Not Test. Converting it to AMD rig. Please Report Bugs)
-Added -Favor_Coins argument. Default is "Yes"
-Combined Windows and Linux Miners into one folder sharing same files.
-Added Config Folder- Placed algorithms files there.
-Added \Config\update.txt
-Due to miner files being combined, you will have to benchmark. However, future updates will no longer your miner files. They will be copied over.
-Ensured T-Rex accepted/rejected are shown correctly on HiveOS.
-Lots of Code-Staging/Prep for AMD mining. Did not add AMD miners (having to change a lot to make it happen).
-Updated Algorithms and their placements to most optimal settings. Should see better hashrates on miners.
-Removed Alexis-Miner. It's depreciated
-Remove ocminer. It's depreciated
-Fixed threshold issues (will test further to confirm).
-Worked on better miner launch sequence
-Fixed myr-gr
-Added algorithms in case pools add them

1.3.9
-Fixed GPU array from double loading GPU index
-Removed extra pool files from github CoinPools folder
-Ensure -Favor_Coins was working.
-Miner will overwrite 1.3.8 versions, but transfer your miner configurations.
-Re-wrote benchmark parameter to test bench before writing stat, will write
message if testbench fails
-Failed Benchmarking should now require 3 failed benches in a row order to write
stat to 0
-Fix T-Rex Hive monitoring: Hashrates will now display correctly for each gpu.
-Added Sonoa
-Started Migration of cmdlets from main source code. Added some notations. Not
finished yet.

-Ensure 100% benchmarking is setting to 0 after 3 failed attempts
-Fixed some HiveOS stat issues from 1.3.9
-Updated Z-Enemy to latest version
-Noticed Times Were inconsistent on "active" screen: Attempted fix
-Removed Erroneus Messages involving closing screens (now that I know it works consistently)
-pidinfo now starts at miner startup, MM.Hash will always close within 5 seconds of it being stopped.
-Started code staging for windows HiveOS API 2.0 (not completed) integration
-Started code staging for HiveOS new version 1.4.0b
-Started code staging for Ubuntu new version 1.4.0c

1.4.0b
HiveOS: Changes:
-Added AMD miners, and changed code to work for AMD in HiveOS (HiveOS only)
-AMD miners are not plug-and-play. You will likely have to edit settings in the miner files, AMD Unix is complicated, but you should be familiar with this.
-Will add more/fine AMD miners- This is simply beta test of core script. Please use and review any issues you see.
-SGminer is not working on blockmasters- It is a pool issue, not miner.
-Fixed stats and have background miner logs sent to "Logs" folder
-Reduced switch load time by a few seconds.
-New Remote command: get-screen [type]...Show last 100 lines of group1 miner on HiveOS site.
-Ensured Timeouts will timeout miners.
-Added Function Restart-Database. Miner will now switch off algorithm/coin if detects no hash after 1 min.
-Times on 'active' command should be more accurate.
-'active' now shows database countdown.
-code staging for Ubuntu version.
-added more algorithm text files that are case specific for naming convetions between pool and miner.
-Enemy 1.1.7
-T-Rex 0.6.2 (added balloon)
-Lots of migrations and code cleanup to make miner better/faster
-Fixed "Logs" error from beta
-Fixed T-rex from beta
-Removed algorithms.txt. It was redundant. Main algorithm list is get-pool.txt...Just remove/add there. get-pool.txt is the
algorithms miner searches for from pools.
-added -SGDevices1 -SGDevices2 -SGDevices3 arguments

1.4.1b beta:

HiveOS Changes:

DISCLAIMERS: 
-I added auto-updates back in, but made it case specific for this release. It may be a good idea to save old miner file settings before updating just in case of failure.
-I made a lot of changed to AMD side, including adding a new system for recording hashrate. Watch and report.
-I made changes to HiveOS stats watch and report
-Avermore does not seem to work in blockmasters for me.
-TDXminer does not seem to work in nicehash for me.
-Claymore works normally, but screen loading is slow for logging (get-screen command)
-To get GPU count for AMD- I am using a different method that I do for NVIDIA. Please let me know if it is displaying correct GPU count. I only have 1 GPU to test.

-Added 0.3.4 Dredge
-Ensured get-screen was working correctly
-removed coin name from "stats". This allows it to clearly show up on HiveOS site.
-Fixed h-stats and commands so I don't accidentally mess up path to commands again.
-Moved khs value to logdata for trex, so Hive will still recieve stats, even when database starts.
-Code staging to remove double local api calls from miners (MM.Hash will send data to h-stats, not both gather information from miner)
-Found some typos of new version- fixed.
-Miner should transfer miner files: Note previous typo on Enemy-CCDevices 2 file You might copy file from github to change) to prevent errors.
-More code staging for Unix version
-Previous Version notes: Poly takes more than 5 minutes to hash an accepted share on lower-model GPUS. You may want to -No_Algo it.
-Confirmed it is possible to combine AMD & NVIDIA, but not possible to get them both to stat on HiveOS (only 1 Device group will work).
-Added tdxminer & new system record hashrate with no api.


1.4.2b beta:

HiveOS version

DISCLAIMERS:
-New t-rex miner gets lower end cards hot for me! watch temps.
-AMD miners currently only work for AMD1 (no grouping yet). NVIDA1 work in groups, but only Group1 sends stats to Hive.
-You CAN run a second instance of MM.Hash on computer if you are using hybrid miner AMD/NVIDIA. Message me for more details if interested. Will create
wiki: It will have to be done through unconventional means.
-lyclMiner is a miner that has no api, and cannot be launched via arguments. Its process for launching/stat tracking is expirmental. I'm over here
working miracles to get these AMD miners that are profitable...Like wth is with AMD miner/programmers?
-all miner files were changed to reflect new stats system (launching/starting) for weird AMD miners.
-Made huge attempts to make stats going to hive more smoother.
-Reduced read/writes to file (Compressing information to singular files)
-Tweaked Monitoring system
-Do not reccommend changing/tweaking miner files or removing stats while miner is running. Could cause issues, due to new process of AMD launching.
-I have only 1 AMD GPU. I believe the hashrate Logging for AMD is correct for each miner, but I have no verifiable proof to know if it working for more
than 1 GPU. I'm going to purchase another AMD card, as these miners are making AMD semi-profitable again.

-New argument -CPUThreads sets -t parameter of CPU miners.
-Cryptozenny is now logging tracked rather than api to prevent benchmarking wait-times.
-Miners now are instance based, should help with Process tracking, and make zombies irrelevant to it.
-Update now has "minername" parameter, which is the name of the executable of the miner. This means you should be able to load your own links in by just changing "minername", if you need to.
-Did lots of benchmarking to reflect new miners- moved around algorithms.
-Axed MSFT difference between MSFT and Tpruvot was marginal for HMQ1725, and Tpruvot is more stable.
-Updated Cryptodredge to latest version (see updatelinux.txt)
-Updated T-Rex to latest version (see updatelinux.txt)
-Minor changes to text on screen for user aid
-Because of all the background logging- Increased Sleep time before stats on screen to 20 seconds, and interval of stats on screen to 15 seconds.
-Changed h-stats.sh to help with the amount of background logging.
-Changes to core script for tracking, code staging for API (API.ps1). Preliminary tests show it is working.

1.4.4b:

-Fixed a typo that prevented possible clearing of content.
-Utilized screen logging with a slight dely to reduce further resources.
-Edited launch timing sequence: May appear slower, but am just giving more time for process to start: No increased delays.
-Updated Crytpodredge
-Updated Enemy
-Code Staging For *nix version
-Added versions in updatelinux.txt (future use: remote command to check miner versions/change links/name.)

1.4.5b:

-Patch for pool data overload.

1.4.6b [and c]

DISCLAIMERS:

This version requires updating drivers to 396
Did not get to fixing anything on AMD side. Still working on it.

There is going to be no c version. b version should now work in Ubuntu:

-download/clone MM.Test (beta version).
-run install.sh as root : sudo ./install.sh. This will install all bash commands.
-open/edit StartMM with your specified arguments.
-Launch MM.Hash (Not as superuser!) ./StartMM
-Operates just like Hive-OS version, just open a new terminal and type desired command.
-requires 396 drivers for nvidia. Have not tested AMD yet.
-requires 'screen' to operate.


-fixed typo in claymore files [-3333]
-added new 'version' command. Will update wiki on use.
-added new 'clear_profits' commmand. Will update wiki on use.
-change nvidia launch to make Hive version work in Ubuntu.
-added install filed for ubuntu install. (used instead of h-run.sh)
-added StartMM, which is the executable to launch ubuntu version.
-added 'benchmark' command.
-updated all miners to cuda 9.2
-changed how updating in MM.Hash works.
-fixed equihash-btg for mph.
-'get-screen' will now get MM.Hash transcript (miner)
-Logs updated to show active log.
-New export folder contains cuda 9.2 library.
-Added CUDA 9.2 libs so ccminers can be recompiled now and used
-Added krnlx-xevan back in for another xevan miner if users want to test. Heard reports it
was faster than enemy.
-Added some more visual aids.
-Removed Algorithm from stats screen. "currently mining is set to print algorithm" at bottom.

1.4.7b:

Disclaimers

Since github repo is changing: Links are dead on screen until I complete
full transision of repo.

-MM.HASH is now "SWARM"
-MM.Hash wiki is not updated, but is still relevant.

Changes:
-Repaired Small Typos
-Add -Force to Timeouts
-Made another attempt to fix timeout benchmark bug (still works fine for me, though)
-Updated miners to recent releases.

New Arguments:

-Cuda
Default is 9.1, so you do not need to add if using 9.1
If you wish to use Cuda 9.2 miners: Add -Cuda 9.2 argument to launch

-HiveOS
Default is "Yes"
If you are using HiveOS, argument is not needed.
If you are running a different OS, it must be added: -HiveOS NO

If you wish to use on a Unix OS other than hive:
run:
sudo ./install.sh
Note: You may have to edit ./install.sh depending on flavor
edit 'swarm' in main directory with your arguments
launch miner by 
./swarm

-New OC-Tuning read "Sample-OC-Nvidia.conf" in config folder to see how to set up.
-Increase donation .05% to reflect additions/new options.
-Updated LISCENSE
-Code-Staging For New ASIC version.

-Added Cuda 9.1 Libraries (in case hive libraries fail again)


1.4.8b

Disclaimers: 

I changed unix miner files in attempt to fix the reported
bug of miners not downloading. I disabled remote updates due to this.

Blockmasters Poolname changed, and has been removed as coinpool.

-New Auto_Coin design:
 -miner now loads top coin from every coin pool for every selected algo.
 -Favor_Coins No will factor Algos + Coins from coin pools.
 -Favor_Coins Yes will always select coins from coin pools.
 -I reccommend using -Auto_Coin Yes, if you are unsure of it- Select
  Favor_Coins No. Miner will only switch to coins if it is higer than
  all api/status algorithms.

-New Arguments
  -StatLevel removed
  -Stat_Algo added [Minute_5] [Minute_10] [Day] [Week]
  -Stat_Coin added [Minute_5] [Minute_10] [Day] [Week]

-Added -Force command to all read-writes to ensure no access denied errors.
-Re-Wrote "WebRequest" cmdlet to new powershell language in attempt to fix bug reports.
 I cannot replicate bug reports, so having issues determining cause. (if it is SWARM related or OS).

New Beta Feature:
Coin-Server
 -launch in terminal (non-remotely) while in SWARM directory "pwsh coin-server.ps1"
 -coin server will update coin data every minute- If works well, will add hashrate data as well,
  and replace coin equations in miner altogether: It will just pull from coin-server. Will likely
  integrate api as well.
 -feature is beta. If you use, please monitor, and report errors or high load increases.

-more code staging for asic.
-started code staging for new windows version. (match HiveOS version)

-Beta version for new coin system. Bugs may be present. Please report so they can be fixed asap.
 Currently regarded as stable from 48 hours of testing.

1.4.9b
Disclaimers:

Miner Files were added/modified. Remote Update Versions Were Disabled Again.
Transferring you oc-tuning file will cause no issues.

-Added lolminer for AMD. Added for NVIDIA version, but stored in "project" folder in miners. Just
 move to "unix" folder to use.

-Other SGMiners do NOT work for all AMD cards. See their github/bitcointalk thread.
-Other SGMiners may require a knowledge/expertise of sgminers to use.
-Depending on your system, you may need to compile these sgminers yourself
-Please DEAR GOD someone find an sgminer dev that knows how linux work!
-My Github is filled with sgminers I had to repair to work in unix environment. They work
 For My RX580- I can't make any gurantees they work for other cards. That's why I moved them
 Out Of Main Folder

XMRig:
-In order to properly parse stats --Nocpu argument was use. HiveOS custom miners
 do not allow for stats of multiple platforms.

 1.5.0b:

 DISCLAIMERS:

 DO NOT USE -Auto_Algo ARGUMENT! IT HAS BEEN REMOVED.

activates watt detection at benchmark. Not stable for larger rigs!
-Miner Now Calculates Power
-power.conf is for manual entries- enter as watts total. Will create helpme soon.
-if WattOMeter is no: miner will defer to power.conf. It should be okay to leave blank-
 I reccommend at least setting a default based on your power limit.

Disclaimers:
-WattOMeter feature causes increased load. Use with discretion with multiple platform use.
-OCTuning feature causes increased driver load. Use with discretion with multiple platform use.
-New Core Program! Front end looks same, backend totally different!
-I have read that using the method to oc tune I use on windows side +
msi afterburner will cause crashes.
-I was having stability issues with NVIDIA miners on windows side-
100% positive it was the miners themselves. I haven't used windows in awhile for tuning them.
-Set a shortcut to startup, and miner will restart at reboot.
-Last rebooot time for windows may be wrong (will fix).
-Load is by % on windows.
-Platform Windows argument must be specified.
-Did not do API for lolminer- Have no pool to test it.
-Cryptodredge threads API for me was timing out a lot. If you experience the same-
message developer.

-Changed logdata screen to 'background'
-background screen shows relevant stat information going to hive (like agent-screen).
-Miner automatically parses -GPUDevices(1,2,3)
-Removed all other -Devices arguments, they are now depreciated
-Not all AMD miners will work with -GPUDevices: They're flawed design, not mine.

-zergpool removed.
-benchmark command now remove power files for wattometer as well. (if using)

1.6.2



Disclaimers:

Dagger does not work on NLPool- leaving it miner regardless in case it does. It's
a good test for new timeout system.
This is mainly update for NVIDIA, and small bug fixes. AMD update coming soon.
Some miner files were changed, so was stat system. Probably ideal to fresh install.
CryptoDredge did not release a cuda 10.0 version of his miner
only cuda 9.1 and 9.2. If you use -cuda 10 and want to use
his new miner- You have to manually update.
CryptoDredge was updated.
Cnv2 added for NVIDIA
To reset bans- run benchmark [algorithm]

-New Argument -Rejections
-Default is 20 (Do not need to specify if you like 20)
-Rejections is the amount of % rejections in order to consider a bad benchmark/strike
-Only flaw to this system, is if rejections are too high: It deletes stat
and forces benchmarking, so pool ban can be enforced.
-Higher the number, the lower chance of enforcement. 100 is maximum.

-New Strike system for benchmarking
-miner no longer sets any stat to 0
-results in more accurate stats.
-strike 1: Notifications
-strike 2: Algorithm ban on said pool
-strike 3: Algorithm ban across all pools
-resets every [x] hours where [x] is -timeout argument

-Ensure stats are cleared before each miner
-prevents cross stat contamination

-Stats will default to 1.000 on HiveOS
-allows user to know miner is running,
but API is awaiting stats.

-Watchdog does not closes down main program (hiveos)
-prevents shutdown of new restarted instance

-Changed ccminer api
-reduces chances of timeouts on SWARM.
-background first gets summary for total HashRates.
-background then tries to get threads.

   This is a beta version.

   FRESH INSTALL MANDATORY
   Linux Version ONLY

   -Wrote small help article for AMD users in help files.

   -Fixed Clamore -Platform issue (AMD)

   -Added argument -OnboardCard. Default is no. Specify Yes if 
    using amd and rocm-smi detects integrated card. Quick fix
    will find better fix in near future

   -re-wrote config folder. config now contains miner control
    files in json format. Adding commands, difficulty, oc
    and pre-start commands are now done there.
 
   -added install git for CPU compiling.

   -Fixed $RAW=0 placement to prevent double stacking of
    hashrates, when total API failure occurs.

   -Converted all config files to json for future use.

   -Changed all miner files for new OC tuning.

   -Changed stats file to come before miner launch.

   -Ensured background agent is started before -delay
    so users can specify delay for OC tuning.

   -OC tuning is now launched in their own screens.
    OC_NVIDIA is for NVIDIA
    OC_AMD is for AMD
    This prevents lockup of any of SWARM's processes
    And lets users check for oc issues.

   -Miners now lauch from one single script, made
    on demand: startup.sh.

   -trex updated, x22i added.

  1.6.7

  There are still beta features in this release.

   folder was deleted- Bans would not
   reset unless restarted. Both -Timeout argument and 
   benchmark timeout commands should now work.

Bleeding Edge is now supported and working.

Because of Bleeding Edge- SWARM cannot restart
agent. You may have to manually restart agent
yourself to update h-stats version.

Type ASIC now in initial test stages. Currently
only have Linux version (not HiveOS). I will
create a write-up on how it works. I was side-lined
with ASIC due to the crazy amount of miner updates/new algos.

     platform will often mine the same algo.
    -WE ARE THE SWARM!

``-Switch_Threshold``
     -Default is ``1`` (for testing)
     -This allows a threshold requirement
      in order to initiate a switch.
     -Figure is percent based.

discord.


1.8.2


-This fixes ``-SWARM_Mode`` parameter and
 millisecond bug.
-SWARM_Mode should work as intented.

New Command (Windows)!

``ps``
  -ps allows you to run powershell/cmd based commands remotely.

   will put your rig offline, just like HiveOS version. You can start
   processes, but use powershell's ``Start-Process`` cmdlet.
  -example:  ``ps Get-Process`` will get you a list of running
   processes on pc.

-Updated trex
-Fixed background miner versions.
-RTX series USB-controller fix. (Stats correct number of GPU's)

This release is mainly a patch for users interested in SWARM_Mode.


1.8.4

Major Changes:

NOTE: FRESH INSTALL HIGHLY SUGGESTED! Beta version from all
the changes/additions.

-Statics have been compeletly rebuilt. 
  -Pool files were all modified,
  -Most of every databasing function has been rewritten.
  -Taking a new, completely my design approach to profit statistics.
  -Taking workers, fees, and pool hashrates into accout- Beyond simple estimates.
  -Entirely new profit equation.
  -Returns seem to be more exact, especially when stat_algo day is used. (but live seems to be best).
  -System is improved, but more changes to account for SWARM_Mode will be made.

-Custom Yiimp Miner Pools
  -You can now create your own mining pool files
  -Instructions on how to create them included in sample file:
    .\algopools\custom.ps1
  -It's as easy as filling out a small 10 question form.
  -Can be duplicated, but same pool duplication not advised.
  -Rename custom.ps1 to bsod.ps1, and you should add a lyra2vc0ban coin
  -Requires wallets for coins- No Auto-Exchange.
  -Useful for testing profitibility of coins outside auto-exchange pools.

-API server now established:
  -http://localhost:4099/summary will get you swarm pricing data
  -http://localhost:4099/getstats will get you mining data
  -Much more is coming soon- Full API method to modify SWARM will exist
  -Sample API for demonstration is included: Sample-API.ps1
      note: As I update API, I will add how to use via Sample-API.ps1
  -Currently this is local, until I finish. I plan to make remote.

-New Arguments:
   -AMDPlatform was removed. Use CLPlatform instead, only if needed.
    Swarm should detect.
   -API: Default is yes, if you have issues, you can remove it its
    by specifying -API No
   -Nicehash_Wallet(1,2,3) no longer needed, however, you can still specify.
   -NiceHash_Fee set to default of 2% if using Nicehash_Wallet, 5% if not (per site).

-Time Syncronization:
  For better SWARM_Mode optimization, all swarm apps will Sycronize
  their time with NIST servers at start.

-Adminstrator
  SWARM now runs in administrator mode. This allows the following:
    -more GUI manipulation.
    -Modify time settings.
    -Launch miners with admin privelages (it helps amd side).
    -modify registry entries for Vega Soft Powerplay Tables.
    -in future: modify registry for gpu optimizations users may
     not be aware of.
    -in future: remotely update NVIDIA/AMD drivers with single command.
    -``ps`` can not run applications as admin
    -ensure security settings are good on your windows computer/network.

-Agent rebuild
  -Rebuilt agent to better gather api stats from miners.
  -Rebuilt C++ software to better gather api stats from GPU drivers.
  -Removed as much error generation as I could possibly find (when API fails).
  -background no longer closes, but still octunes when switch occurs. (within a few seconds).
  -GPU stats are gathered from hive stats file, no gpu api is used.
  -Rebuilt linux api gpu stat generation.
  -Rebuilt windows api gpu stats generation.
  -Rebuilt most of the api's for each miner.
  -Focused on lowered mem use, and resource uses...However more things
   are happening in background, so there should be no change.
  -There is a table corruption in .\odvii.exe. This is an AMD driver bug.
   I cannot fix, but it doesn't seem to cause issues. It just creates error logs
   in windows event veiwer.

-New miners
  -bminer added
  -zhash & Phoenix Miner API are fixed (I believe).
  -warning: Miniz was giving me issues.
  -warning: ccmineryescrypt, cryptodredge, fancyIX,
            wildrig on certain algos may cause issues.
  -warning: Some AMD gpu's may not run all AMD miners.

-Bus statistics fixed.
  -Better GPU detection.
  -Windows now automatically detects OpenCL Platform
     note: This was working for me. Please let me know
     if you have issues.
  -Does not count GPU's that SWARM isn't using
     note: This was working for me. Please let me know
     if you have issues.
  -Removed NVIDIA integrated motherboard cards from count.

-Minimized
   -All windows are either ran hidden/minimized except main
    window.
   -Windows will now set their own colors for visualization
    optimizations.

-Crash reporting
   -If miner is restarted- SWARM detects this, and will
    perform an crash report.
   -Crash reports takes a "flashed image" of all debugging
    data located txt folder, which accounts for 75% of SWARMs
    internal statistics.
   -This data is unchanged, which means you can review incidents,
    what miners were running, etc., to determine failures. Or send
    me the crash report, and let me figure it out.

-Miners Updated

-Gui fixes everywhere. Attempted to remove as many erroneous powershell
 errors/warnings as possible.

-Lots, and lots, and LOTS of small fixes. Too many to detail.
 

1.8.5

NOTE: Windows user can run get update to remote update. This will
be first working instance of it, and it deletes old version folder
in original directory. You may want to make a backup of it first.

NOTE: I am having a hard time with setting SWARM to startup in
windows. Windows blocks the .bat file if added to startup. You have
to add the new file path yourself. I am working on fix.

NOTE: Windows updated in order- 1.8.3 to 1.8.4, 1.8.4 to 1.8.5, etc.

-WildRig Updated
-CryptoDredge Updated
   Note- CryptoDredge algos were removed. A fair amount.
         I didn't code automatic removal on your old files.
-nicehash eq to eu
-small 'tweaks' to profit calc.
-cpu only stats table in agent.
-overdrive api (new version) was not working
 the program was corrupted. I reverted back to original.
 this means no fans/stats for Vega on windows. :(
-watt/day will only show if you have watt values.
-attempted fix for better XMR-STAK stats.
-Increased actual miner ban count to six- meaning 3 bad algo
 runs, and it is banned.
-fixed AMD temps/fans for HiveOS.
-Small Gui fixes with commands.
-Fixed Sgminer stats for good (I think).
-Rolled back vega support for windows. Sorry. It still works, just
 fans and temps won't stat.
-Small tweaks to XMR-STAK/XMRIG api.
-Added lolminer for zhash (AMD).
-Removed tpruvot- Depreciated.
-Added more GUI notations.

1.8.6

Critical X16r patch for 1.8.5

1.8.7 (Not Released)

-Windows version will start connection to HiveOS as soon as first
 agent window starts.

-Fixed commmand ``get benchmarks`` to show only benchmarks.

-Made it so that if command fails- It will not display old commands (Windows).

-Agent message spacing is cleaner

-SWARM_MODE was causing an issue with "Becnhmark Miner" command- It was resolved.

-Agent will now build empty stats array if SWARM is not running (Windows).
 This allows you not to have to wait for miners to download to connect flightsheet.

-Fixed API stats so it is all in KHS (include making decimal for Sol/s).

-Found Issue with multiple device groups not sending total hash to API- resolved.

-Noticed some incorrect hash units being sent to HiveOS (khs was mhs, etc)- resolved.

-SWARM will remotely notify you if there is no miners available (argument/pool/miners issues).

-Migrated More Output files to .\build\txt instead of bash folder. (Helps with debugging).

-SWARM will not remove its tar.gz download for HiveOS.

-SWARM will now copy over last known miner logs into crash-reports.

-SWARM will clean Trash folder for HiveOS (remove old miners/downloads).

-Much better organization of API/summary. Organized by type, then profits (or pool estimates if no benchmarks).

-Lite Mode disables timeout system (so you can run, and it won't block miner stats).

-Removed API-Sample.ps1, will add back when I am finished (Still changing it).

-Added ``-Remote`` parameter, for making API remote.

-Added ``-APIPassword`` parameter, to set a password endpoint on remote api.

-Upadated Help_File with new arguments.

-Increased miner ban to 12 count default (because of zergpool equihash).

-Zergpool Added. Equihash Algos fixed. (I was having trouble with some on zergpool).

-KW/h cost can now be set hourly by power.json, for variable rates. If use in conjucntion
 with ``-Conserve Yes`` argument, you can effectively stop mining if values drop to negative.

-Moved Custom pools to custompools directory. Swarm will check that folder now.

1.8.9

-API now runs through background screen.
-API with windows closes 1 second after background screen exit.
-New default configs (if new are developed) will automatically be added to windows flight sheet.
-Fixed CryptoDredge Download.
-Fixed SWARM re-download on reboot.
-Rolled back deletion of tar.gz from hive downloads folder.
-Windows NVIDIA should now oc with default all GPU's (not just per card)
 If you have only 1 value set.
-API summary table loads faster.

-Rebuilt version command from scratch. It should work decent now.
-version update command should work for regular *nix users, but
 it will not restart SWARM (Working on restart commands).
-version command is new, and is beta- report if issues.


1.9.0

-Windows by default will add itself to startup. (``-Startup No`` to disable).
-Added new algos on zergpool (trex).
-Fixed Version command issues on linux side.
-Slowed the update process down on Windows side: It appears to resolve issues.
-Added -i 12.5 to ccminer yescrypt algorithms.
-Updated gminer links. Moved gminer back into production.
-Whalesburg Pool added (please let me know how your returns factor in comparison to nicehash).
-clear_watts command added- resets power.json.
-clear_profits now works in windows.
-miner restart now works in windows.
-``get wallets`` displays altwallets.
-zergpool added to wallet list.
-New arguments
   ``-Eth`` Eth wallet address
   ``-Worker`` Used where worker is needed (Whalesburg pool).
   ``-Startup`` Default "yes". Adds SWARM to windows startup.
-Select only single Process ID for miners that run multiple processes. (linux)
-gminer API fixed.
-configs for equihash miners (- instead of --) fixed.
-new miner esshand/ccminer for windows/linux
-added algorithms to lolminer.
-wallet table now is shown as decimal instead of scientific notations.

1.9.1

Note: cuckoo will not work for lower-end cards.
Note: Suggested AMD drivers for Windows: 18.6.1.
Note: It is highly advised for linux users to 410.93 drivers.

-zjazz bitcash added.
-argon2d miner for AMD added.
-xmrig updated
-new api command: /getbest
-found/fixed typo for default claymore_amd file for Ethash.
 affected fresh install or users that did not remote update.
-was getting stability issues from a claymore/phoenix miner export. 
 Removed it.

 1.9.2

 -Zjazz multiplier fixed for pool vs. miner. You may want to rebenchmark it.
 -Note: Solution was discussed on handling MTP. Will have something next release.

-``version update`` command can be ran with 'source' rather than
   uri, allowing users to update miners from swarm repository.
   example: 
   ``version update gminer miner 1.21 source``

-gminer 1.21
-Ehssand for AMD.
-added glt token algos to wildrig.
-bminer 13.0 updated & added to windows.
-added 1445 back to bminer.
-API watchdog start first, then server.


1.9.3

Note: With new -No_Algo1,-No_Algo2,-No_Algo3 arguments
      you will be able to divide rig, allowing smaller
      number of gpus to mine algos like mtp and cuckoo.
      This allows larger rigs to still be able to mine
      algorithms.

Example: ``-Type NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2 -GPUDevices1 0,1 -GPUDevices2 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 -No_Algo2 mtp,cuckoo``
          The above example: GPU 0 & 1 will factor mtp and cuckoo, Remaining GPUS will not.

Note: Huge change in miner files. Windows users: z-enemy stats may not transfer over.
      Linux users- No miner stats may transfer over on update.
      Miner filenames were changed to enforce simplistic Uniformity- It had to be done
      eventually.

Note: Update to fix glt-astralhash for wildrig will work.

-Noticed small bug in version command. Works as intented,
 but windows version posted to hiveOS too soon before was finished.
-Fixed powershell bug -ne was failing for zjazz stats.
-Added ``-No_Miner`` argument. See help file for use.
-Uniformity of all miner names.
-``No_Algo`` argument has been removed.
-Added ``-No_Algo1`` argument. See help file for use.
-Added ``-No_Algo2`` argument. See help file for use.
-Added ``-No_Algo3`` argument. See help file for use.
-gminer 1.22
-xmrig removed from rotation, as XMR-STAK now has dual threads

Note: First time users may notice profit calculations are
different compared to other available mining applications.
This is intentional- My method of calculation is different,
and has been discussed at length and supported by userbase.

Note: ``-SWARM_Mode Yes`` allows all SWARM users to switch at same
time. All rigs/users will be syncronized. This does not
apply to pool or choice of miner- Just switching times.

1.9.4

-Algo/Pool specific prohibition.
   -users can turn "off" algorithms on certain pools.
   -to turn "off", add the pool name to "config\pools\pool-algos.json"
   -instructions are inside the .json itself.
-Found typo for ehssand amd minername
-rewrote entire ADL for windows AMD, stats will match correct GPU.
 fan % will match. temp will work correctly. Vega works.
 note about vega/amd cards: reported fan speeds are based on maximum
 rpm, which is gathered from ADL/vbios. Some manufacturers have incorrect
 fan speed, resulting in incorrect fan %. If you wish fixed- Report to manufacturer.
-Code staging for ADL oc and autofan
-Fixed xmr-stak stats to display summary hashrate faster.
-Added energiminer for windows
-``ps`` command will now wait until process finishes, and should work correctly.
-Miner Logging for background miners is a little better in windows
-Windows users can run ``nvidia-smi`` remotely.
-Small tweaks to profit table.
-Moved ports on all nebutech miners to help with benchmarking.

-HiveOS OC for AMD in windows.
   -Read config\oc\new_sample.json on how it works.
   -It is not the same as linux OC.
   -Drivers MUST be at least 19.1.1
   -Advised to install 18.6.1 driver,
    then update (without clean install / install over)
    if this is not done- some miners may fail.
    to 19.1.1

-Windows will now generate a swarm-start.bat file in
 each miner folder in .\bin
    -This allows you to test miners with
     swarm settings.
     
-Cleaned up code base- A lot.
-teamredminer update.
-progpowminer added.
-ttminer added.
-wildrig updated.
-Crytpodredge updated.
-bminer updated. (note: beam not working)
-gminer updated.
-trex updated.
-cc-mtp added.
-fixed cc-yescrypt naming.

1.9.5

-Added cc-mtp windows
-Power Target set for HiveOS oc setting 
  1[value]  for positive (125 is +25 power target)
  2[value]  for negative (225 is -25 power target)
        works with vegas. Requires 19.1.1 drivers.
        install 18.6.1, upgrade to 19.1.1 (not clean install)

-Upgraded gminer
-Added lyra2rev3 support
-ProgPowMiner recompiled in linux, used Cuda 10 toolkit

   Install 19.1.1 Drivers (Do not select "clean install")
   This will ensure OpenCL for some miners are correct.

-Full ADL oc for AMD should match HiveOS
    -Core State is ignored- It doesn't matter in Windows.

      of algorithms.
-Code staging for wallet swapping (not done yet).

1.9.8

test release

1.9.9

HUGE NOTE:

There are soooo many developers botching cuckoo algorithms.
I am adding whatever they state they add, support whatever
they support. If it doesn't work- consult developers. They
are prone to lots of glitches and issues. See memory requirements
for each miner.

I can provide limited support on their uses. I have spent days
testing miners, and I frankly give up. I will just add as I see
them...And I let whatever doesn't work timeout.

Bminer works fine in linux. Windows version I kept version the same.
Windows users may get algorithms that fail immediately from this-
SWARM will ban them, as usual.

-grin-miner added for AMD in linux
-gminer added for amd, doesn't work (no opencl detection).
-cd miner updated, beam added, doesn't work.
-many, many miners were updated and tested.
-x16rt and miners on nlpool is experimental.
-added veil support for nlpool.
-added cuckoo31 support for bminer.
    note: This will work with 8gb nvidia cards, highly reccommend.
    note: This will not work with windows.

-added killcx script to help with bad miners that won'table
 free ports. killcx is now depency for linux.

-added launch scripting for grin-miner.toml.

-xmr-stak was compiled with reduce developer fee.

-commands like ``stats`` ``benchmark`` ``active`` and other common
 commands can now be ran through windows locally- may require restart
 after PATH variable is set. Open cmd.exe and then run the command.


 2.0.0

 Important

 ``GPUDevices`` arguments have changed. For simplicty-
 Removed the need to add ' ' for devices
      i.e. ``-GPUDevices1 1,2,3,4,5``  okay
      i.e. ``-GPUDevices1 '1,2,3,4,5'`` depreciated
 -Removed beam from cryptodredge.
 -removed ethash (not nicehash) from bminer.

2.0.1

Important: Default -Cuda is on -Cuda 10 in 
linux! If you want to use 9.2, use -Cuda 9.2,
about 1/4 of the miners will not be loaded.

Changes for generic *nix packages:

-SWARM for the sake of confusion now
 requests to start with sudo. Half the
 features/functions will not work if
 you do not run with sudo.

-chmod .local/share/powershell folder after
 installer is ran, to prevent future access
 denied errors if not ran in root.

-libcurl3 added to installer, for 18.04
 distributions.

-added persistance mode ENABLE to NVIDIA oc.
 (for generic *nix)

Other Changes:

-fixed small typo in device group 3

-moved some installer processes for hive
 into if ($HiveOS -eq "yes), to prevent error
 output on generic version.

-add fans to NVIDIA oc.

-axed zjazz

-Attempted fix of AMD fans/temps in HiveOS.

-Note: energiminer stats are gathered through
 logs, as it has no API. It can take up to
 two minutes before it gathers individual
 gpu hashrates. This cannot be controlled.
 Contact developer to make API.

-``get stats`` and ``get stats lite`` 
   can now be shortened!
   example: ``get stats 10``: Shows you top 10
   example: ``get stats lite 10``: Shows you top 10
   in shortened version for cell-phones.

-phoenix miner arguments updated.

-enable serialization build of dag. This may solve
 those having issues with ethash miners at startup.

-updated bminer
-updated gminer
-updated fancyIX
-updated lolminer- merged versions
-updated klausT

-removed libcrypto.so.1: This may cause
 compatibility issues in Ubuntu 18.04 (bleeding edge).
 I am working on fix, but it was causing errors to
 some miners in 16.04 versions.

 2.0.2

 -Fixed Stats table output to not miss algorithms
   (was glitching in linux faulty match operator)

 -Changed Databasing from standard Arrays, to
  resizable arrays- Seems to help in Linux.

 -Compressed miner pulling functions to one
  .ps1 file.

 -Database now works by adding everything
  then eliminating miners via resizable
  Arrays.

 -Improper $stats use in minerpool files-
  changed to prevent possible glitches.

 -Aded miners to exclude back to pool-algos.json

 -Coded Staging for intelligent versioning, so SWARM
  will detect previous versions, and only apply updates
  for that version, not for all prior. This will prevent
  potential losses of data.

2.0.3

Warning: Fan speed will not work in HiveOS for RTX cards in
Windows. I am working on a fix.

-New Optional Arguments
   -Algorithm
    Algorithm lets you select algorithms of your choice.
   -Coin
    Coin will mine a specific coin
    Example: -Poolname nlplool,blockmasters,zergpool -Algorithm x16r -Coin RVN

-With new arguments- SWARM will automatically select
 best miner for combination (after benchmarking).
 Note: SWARM does not auto-detect if coin is on Pool yet.
       That feature is coming soon.

-Updated Bminer
-Updated ttminer- Added lyra2rev3
-Updated lolminer:
   created 2 versions for linux --asm kernel

Note: Am aware that XMRig and XMRstak have Updates
      skipped over until I see what Nicehash does
      regarding fork. They boast no improvements other
      than adding algorithms.

-Fixed bugs with AMD oc in Linux.
-Fixed lolminer crashes with new version update.
-Updated CPU miner algos:
    -Note: Binarium miners are incaple of making a
    generic version for linux. They must be built directly
    on PC. Cannot add in linux.

-improved bminer compatiblity in bleeding edge/Ubuntu 18.04 - libcurl

-Added AMD oc tool to install.ps1 for generic *nix versions.

-Updated cuckoo names, since HiveOS updated.
   -Note: Did not add to remote update.
          Either use new pool-algos.json,
          or leave as-is.
          Will add to update in future version.

-Some more removal of powershell errors in windows
 agent between miner switches (still trying to find them all).

-SWARM will detect if there is C:\ , if not it assumes it is working
 on a linux OS, if so, then it will assume it is working on
 windows OS

-SWARM will now notify you if you accidentally place a file or folder 
 in a directory it shouldn't be in, instead of outputting powershell
 errors.

-Fixed issue in which some miners where skipped over on initial benchmarks
 from new database system.

-get active shows name of miner instead of speed- It was redundant,
 however, you can now tell which miner is which if they have the same
 exe name.

###############################################################################
###############################################################################

 2.0.4

 NOTE: AMD Users- Gminer_amd is in project folder. To acivate, move to gpu folder.
  ``mv /hive/miners/custom/SWARM.2.0.4/miners/project/gminer_amd.ps1 /hive/miners/custom/SWARM.2.0.4/miners/gpu``

 New Feature!
   SWARM will now create startup.sh inside .\bin\[minername] dir, which allows a test run of
   last known settings.

 -TTminer -di to -d for devices.
 -TTminer lyra2v3 fix
 -Removed more window background agent powershell errors (turned into warnings)
 -Slowed launchcode for miner down, there was chance bash script would finish before read/write
  of instance.
 -Fixed more hiveOS algo naming.
 -Gminer_Amd is now working.
    -added in project folder- to use, move to gpu folder.
    -may crash hybrid rigs / doesn't work for rigs with AMD & NVIDIA.
-updated gminer
-updated xmr-stak: added new algos.
-updated xmrig: added new algos.
-Windows: reboot now closes SWARM first, then reboots.
    -displays message on screen.
-Added reboot.ps1
-Cleaned up Claymore/ethminer style API for windows agent errors.
-Removed -pers auto args on grin algo launches- Did not add to remote update.
-Added cryptonight/r
-Removed lyra2z from fancyIX- It would just crash cards.

2.0.5

Note: ``start-stop-daemon`` is now dependency of SWARM for
    linux. It comes with HiveOS & Ubuntu, may not with
    other OS's.

 The entire linux launch sequence is written- I advise
 to be prepared to rollback if issues, and save your
 backup and config folder remotely to not lose data.

-Linux: Launchcode reconfigured.
 -uses natively designed ``start-stop-daemon`` to create
  an artificial handle that SWARM can track.
 -PID files are generated to build\pid
 -Info regarding path information and dates are generated
  to build\pid
 -This should eliminate startup errors for good, in regards
  issue with "file cannot be found!" instance errors.
 -Swarm will now launch exectuable directly, will not rename.
 -Swarm continues to make startup test script in .\bin folder.
 -This may help with miners that zobmie on startup for some
  users (usually that is GPU compatibility issues).

-Windows: Removes old PATH settings for SWARM, so there isn't
          issue with updates, or moving folder.
          -environment.ps1 added
          -can now run ``get update`` locally through cmd.exe
           and through HiveOS.
             (must be running cmd.exe as administrator)
          -new ``get update`` will happen upon updating to
           next version- Will not work updating to this release.

 -New Features!
    ``benchmark help`` added
    -can now do benchmark miner [minername] [algo]
    ``-CoinExchange`` is now an optional parameter.

 -cnr added to teamredminer on update.
 
 -Get-ChildItemContent now converts items into an array of non-fixed
  size from start, in hopes to resolve conversion issues.

 -moved ehssand_amd to project folder. FancyIX is faster, and ehssand
  is very buggy (no further developement).

 -devices are now parsed literally to avoid issues between OS's.
    -This should finally resolve issues with OC starting.
    -This does NOT resolve issue with AMD and integrated cards
     on linux- I am working on fix.

 -progminer recompiled, attempted to fix NVIDIA issue.
 -bminer updated
 -wildrig updated, added rainforest algorithm

 2.0.6

 -This is a beta hot-fix version in attempt to fix the following issues:

         https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/issues/31
         https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/issues/27
         https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/issues/28

        
 -Log settings are now parsed at miner.ps1/miner phase
       -Hoping this will resolve anti-hacking issues:
       -Miners that have a logging command will defer
        to logging.
       -Miners that have no logging feature- SWARM will
        attempt to log.
        -May improve miner screen output in windows for
         some miners.

 -Found and fixed typo in new benchmark command for
  ``miner``.

 -Discovered / applied more proper way to implement
  system.collections.arraylists

 -added balloon to pool-algos.json (somehow was missed).
   -note: no exchange stats from pool. Won't load in
    profit switching.

 -implemented changes I maded a few versions back to
  algopools to custompool files (I missed doing so).

 -found typo when loading custompools. It is now fixed.

 2.0.7

 New Feature!
   Windows: ``get update`` now allows a link to be used.
     example: ``get update https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/releases/download/v2.0.7/SWARM.2.0.7.zip``

 -Found typo from beta 2.0.6 in bminer-1.ps1
   overwrote "-" from -api
 -wildrig updated
 -bminer updated
 -ttminer updated
 -xmrig updated
 -xmrig-nvidia added
 -xmr-stak updated
 -teamredminer updated
 -phoenix miner updated
 -built another version of ProgPOW for testing

 -Applied proposed fix https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/issues/34 
 
 2.0.8

 NOTE: I have set SWARM up for git. You do not have to
 technically update with new link. Here is quick steps
 if you wish to set up git:

     1.) run the following command:
         ``git clone https://github.com/maynardminer/SWARM.git /hive/miners/custom/SWARM``
     2.) Leave link empty in flight sheet
     3.) Set miner as SWARM   (important: No .name.of.version)

  If you wish to update miner going forward, direct from developement:

     ``cd /hive/miners/custom/SWARM && git pull``

  If you wish ever wish to update from beta test branch developement:

     ``cd /hive/miners/custom/SWARM && git checkout beta_testing``

   **Note: Releases are released for a reason. Use with caution**

  Commands are same for windows, but git must be installed.
  These commands will work remotely. SWARM will transfer
  old SWARM.Name.Of.Version folders if ``-update Yes`` is
  specified, or if using in windows (automatically).

 -I believe I fixed all miners, and logging, so they will
  no longer cause issue with anti-hacking / tee
 -added verushash algorithm / cc-verus
 -4th decimal for stats (for Sol/s)
 -``get stats lite`` much cleaner on cell phones.
    Good alternative for ``get stats`` on the go.
 -fixed nicehash wallets in ``get wallets``
 -miner typo fixes.
 -added ProgPOW devices (for NVIDIA2 and NVIDIA3)
 -attempted new compile again- Still works for me
  on both RTX and GTX cards. Compiled with Cuda 10.1
  this time.
 -added cuda-10.1 libs to export folder. It seems
  cuda 10.0 and 10.1 are interchangable. no need for
  ``-Cuda 10.1``
 -improved miner displays in windows, where possible.

 2.0.9

 -Removed Some Params no longer used.
 -Upated xmrig-nvidia link on linux.
 -updated phoenix miner 4.2b
 -updated teamredminer
 -gminer updated in windows (missed)
 -wildrig updated

Nebutech / Equihash miners telemetry #51
Reduce background.ps1 size #47 
Wildrig-Multi Doesn't Start Up #58
Logging Errors #52
Covert API from Job to Runspace #57 
Improve Pool Profit Calculations #45 
New ttminer #55 
New Phoenix Miner #53

Beta Test Version- 2.1.1 will be final.

2.1.1 (Official Release)

Items / Enhancements / Issues:

 Allow specifying more levels for fans speed #26 
 Add config\wallets\wallets.json #43 
    -This allows you to be more specific regarding
     the use of your wallets.
    -This was heavily self-tested by myself, but I
     always am concerned about larger changes such at this.
     If you use, please keep an eye on wallet address and
     ensure there is no issues.
  -``get active`` shows active miners that aren't active #66 
  -z-enemy / t-rex port overlap NVIDIA3 #65
  -``get wallets`` command was redone, much cleaner output.

   config\wallets\wallets.json has instructions inside the
   .json on how to use. NOTE: -AltWallet and -AltPassword
   arguments are MEANT to overwrite this config, so you can
   force bind wallets remotely. If you use this config, don'table
   use -AltWallet arguments.


2.1.2

``-AUTO_COIN`` is back and highly improved!!
  * features a more streamlined design.
  * faster calculations that before.
  * better analysis between coins vs. algorithms. 
    (However, still asyncrounous in design)
  * no possibility of GUI stat issues.
  * pre-tested by users.
  * Note: Coins by design in Yiimp source code
    are calculated asyncrounously between algorithm
    profits. Stats will never match algorithm pricing,
    but a more accurate / live figure is generated.
  * Currently only zergpool.
  * Plans to add fairpool coming very soon (after feedback
    of bug / issue correction).

-Shares 
  * SWARM now tracks user share count on certain pools.
  * zergpool will only work if -Auto_Coin yes is on.
  * I am still working on all pools. Not all pools are
    supported.

New Commands:

 ``-get charts``
   * will display a bar graphic chart on miners, in 
     relation to each other.
   * not implemented but coming soon: Can be sorted
     by user input.

API overhaul:
  * API can now run 80% of commands through it.
  * If a command has an argument, it is parsed with an '&'
  * examples:
    * http://localhost:4099/get&stats
    * http://localhost:4099/version&query

  * minor fixes on commands (I'm not sure if all working, I was
    still testing while coding -Auto_Coin, report if a command give
    you an issue.

-Various small fixes were performed, too numerous to account for each one.
-Most of them were small fixes found while going through miner files, and
 had little to no real affect to the performance of SWARM.

-build\api created, plan to use this for all api uses, via with other programs,
 or with SWARM itself.

-ASIC is working! (remote version verified)
   * tested only remote version.
   * two new arguments are added for ``-Type ASIC``
     * ``-ASIC_IP`` is the IP of the ASIC. If installing
       directly on ASIC, this argument is not needed.
     * ``-ASIC_ALGO`` algorithms to be use for asic
          comma seperated if more than 1
     * new command for ASIC support:
       * ``get asic``
       * This will allow you to get details of
         the asic, and return in a readable format.
    * I will generate wiki after initial user testing.
    * Should work with other device types (if using remotely).
    * DOES NOT work with HiveOS. I will not create support for HiveOS- 
      If you wish support, use HiveOS image, and then run SWARM with it.

-New COMMAND:
  * ``get charts``: Since so much data is being displayed in stats
      screen, I have attempted to make a better visualization of the
      stats, using simple comparative bar charting.

-I tried to push out release and over 10k changes to codebase asap,
 core features are working 100%, some sub-features may have been broken
 due to new changes. If you see any issues- please report, and I will fix
 asap.

``-CoinExchange`` is now calculated pre-power figures, so before watt
   calculations are added in. So you can use -CoinExchange BTC to get
   calculations before watt applied, and then the normal BTC /day will
   be after.

-Linux version will now set core speed for all AMD P-States, not just
 the p-state for Mdpm (minor bugfix).

  Github Other fixes / Enhancements references:
  * Update XMR-Stak #83
  * OC - Added details for memory voltage and fan speed setting on Windows #75

  2.1.4

  -Fixed small typos in Phoenix miner.
  -Fixed small typos in XMrig miner files.
  -Background screen should stat only group 1 algos (AMD1,NVIDIA1)
   or stat CPU if only CPU.
  -Invoked security protocols for ``get update`` command.
  -Invoked tls security protocols for background agent.
  -Added yespower8 and yespowerr32 algos to pool files
   (will load a yespower8 algo miner soon).
  
  As of 2.1.3, miner files were heavily changed so that
  there is only 1 .ps1 file for each miner. This invovled
  changing a lot. If you see any further bugs, please report.

  2.1.5

  This release continues to fix little issues reported with
  api and hashrates. It is reccommended to update to it.
  
  -Entire background agent was redone:
    -API now lists ASIC hashrates.
    -CPU now lists individual threads (if miner supports it).
    -API now lists CPU hashrates.
  
  -New Miner:
     -cpuminer-sugarchain: Created by Cryptozenny
     -It is reccommended on slower CPU's to increase
      benchmark times.
  
  -Fixed Gminer API issues.
  -Fixed Gminer miner.ps1 and device launch.
  -Moved xmrig_nv to optional folder- Too many
   users report crashes from compiling issues.
  -Updated bubaik cpu miner
  -Fixed ethminer API.
  -Replaced x16rt to veil for HiveOS.

  New Windows HiveOS information!
   -SWARM now sends C: size and free space.
   -Slighly improved RAM measurements.
   -Windows version now includes everything on
    HiveOS accept watchdog and autofan. (working on it).
   -Shows correct CPU AES support.

  -Added some more libs for export to support miners.

  -``get wallets`` command: Some pools balances
    show differently. I removed totaling of unpaid
    and paid combination, as it was inaccurate.

  -New Feature!
    -wallets.json config now has AllAltWallets.
     For auto-coin, Miner will intuitively switch to address of same
     coin if it is most profitable to mine if AllAltWallets
     is listed with the rest of the config.

  -Minor fixes of .ps1 files.

  NOTE: I have not completed the AMD miners in the optional folder.
  The will not work as of now- It is the next immediate thing I plan
  To Do.


  2.1.6

  -Fixed All_Altwallets in Wallet.Json. Should be working now.
  -Made it so that ``-Coin`` argument disables ``-Auto_Coin``.
  -Made it so that ``-Coin`` argument disables ``-Altwallet``  related arguments.
  -Fixed ``-No_Miner`` so that it uses naming conventions from
   stats screen (for each devices group), rather than name of
   .ps1 file.
  -Wallet tables doesn't stat automatically stat ``-Wallet1`` as
   BTC, in case ``-Coin`` parameter is used.
  -Refreshed Wallets API, should be working.
     (Note, will only display if you have unsold coins / actively mining).
  -Added blazepool coin shares.
  -Minor tweaks to API codebase / cleaning.
  -Noticed small error in HiveOS stats: ccminers were showing mhs
   when they should be showing khs: Fixed.
   not by .ps1 file name now.
  -All_Altwallets are fixed.
  -Changed shares % to stat at N3 (3rd decimal place).
  -Gminer updated
     -Gminer runs better than lolminer for AMD.
     -Moved Gminer into AMD rotation.
     -Suggest to look into optimizing for equihash mining.
  -Fixed bug involving coins not being selected with the same name
   as algo (only if a pool with algo option was present).

  New Features!

  -zpool can now auto_coin switch.
  
  2.1.7

  #106 fixed gminer and grinminer AMD oc

  -Fixed z-enemy miner numbering for device groups.
  -Added progpow to Phoenix Miner for AMD.
  
  New Miner
  * Nebutech Miner added!

  New Features!
  * Time stamps on output / logging.
  * Windows Side formatting has Now
    been changed to match linux formatting
    on main screen.
  * SWARM will now generate a batch to
    open CMD / basic instructions on
    desktop in windows (for commands).

  -Performed some code staging for
   oc & web control (not implemented yet).

  -AMD optional_and_old miners were updated
   to new .ps1 format (some may not work in
   general). I did not test, as I don't
   support them.

  -miner screens in windows output was fixed
   further, for miners that do not support logging.
   (Windows)

  2.1.8

  NOTE: Remote Updates has been disabled! You will not be able to
  remote update, and version must be cleanly installed. Transferring
  old statistics and miners will cause major errors.

  HUGE UPDATE

  -Statistics system is now greatly improved, and was completely
  rewritten. Here are the bullet points:
  * Statistics for time frames are now based on exponential
    weighted moving averages.
  * ``-Stat_All`` argument has been added which when enabled to
      Yes, it will pull / save ALL coin stats. However, this is
      a huge expenditure of CPU and system resources to do. Not
      reccommend on 2 threaded CPU's. Default is No
  * ``-Custom_Periods`` argument has been added. This will allow the
      user to specify the number of periods that SWARM should gather
      its data from, with "periods" defined as each pull from pool.
      Default is 1 (to reduce use).
  * Stat files will store values from every pull from pool.
  * Stats are pulled on demand, and only when needed to reduce RAM use.
  * Default is still Live stats.

  Note: This new statistics system does increase load times slighty.
  It is a little more stressful on USB sticks as well. If you are 
  using USB, you may consider increasing -Interval, and limiting
  Number of ``-Type`` you use. This system is much better, but does
  increase resource use.

  -Overclocking system was reworked- It now runs sycnrously to miner
   launch. It will close miner, start OC, and then open miner when finished.
   * OC values are displayed on main screen when this occurs.

  -Added "fees" to miner files. SWARM now factors fees into calculations.

  -Switch culture for time data to ENUS to avoid weird time errors.
  
  -Screen will now display average profit / day
  -Screen will now display current profit / day

  -``view`` command has been created. This allows a command to be run
     that will refresh every ``-n`` seconds. ``-OnChange`` flag will
     make it so that it will only update screen if output has changed.
     * example: ``view get stats -n 60 -OnChange``
       This will run the command ``get stats`` every 60 seconds,
       and if the output is different- Will update the console screen.

  New Miner!
  SRBMiner

  -bminer Updated
  -ttminer updated
  -wildrig Updated
  -teamredminer updated

    2.1.8

  Bug Fixes:
    -Resored zpool Auto_Coin
    -Fixed timeout looping issue

  Default Changes:
    -All miner files that has "_" in its name was changed to "-"
    -This resovles 'get-benchmark' issues.
    -The miner.json in config folder will not be tranferred on update.
        -You may have to fill out that file.
    -Stat_Algo and -Stat_Coin defaults are now "Day"

  New Features!

   -Miners are "Pre-sorted"
        -Instead of pulling all the miner files, and creating a miner
         combination for every coin / algo, miners hashrates are compared
         first. This means only the miners that have the highest hashrates
         will be added to the initial database, reducing load times.
        -This new method reduces the time it takes to load miners / database
                 On Pentium 2 thread CPU:
                 -With one algo pool - ~20 seconds
                 -With one coin pool - ~1 minute
                 -With two coin pools - ~2 minutes
                 -With two coin pools and -Stat_All "Yes": ~3 minutes.
                 -All pool combos and -Stat_All "Yes": ~4-5 minutes.
        -This makes -Stat_All Yes on lower end CPU's feasable.
        -Stat_All Yes means EVERY coin statistic is stored (that are gpu mineable)
         when pool is qued for data, not just the ones that are most profitable.
         This allows for better historical data for ``-Stat_Algo``
        -SWARM always only uses a single CPU thread.

   -SWARM log is greatly improved.
      -transcript method was removed.
      -SWARM now logs screen output in the same manner it was displayed.
      -SWARM will store verbose warning/error output that was created
       at the end of each loop, and and startup.
      -get screen miner output is much cleaner.

    -Cleaned up some more older miner files.
    -Some old .ps1 files were removed.
    -Cleaned some of the codebase (Spring Cleaning)
    
    Note: There is further I can do to reduce load times for
    Database sorting, I am working on it.



    2.2-frickin.0

   Note: Thank you very much for your patience and
   helping me assist with trial and error of figuring
   out this new system. I am fairly certain as of this
   release, every bug has been fixed with your help,
   and we now have an awesome new system.

   -Volume equation changed, performs much better.
    * Volume had an issue with conversion of [Double]
    * This issue made it appear to work, but the calcs
      were off.
    * After 100+ debug trials, I have confirmed for myself
      it is correct now. Pre-Tested by trial users.

   -Pool Load times for coins sped up.
        -Over 50% faster. This includes -Stat_All.
         Using more sophisticated pipeline input to
         reduce time.
    
   -Forced Stat conformity.
       -if there are more than 3 tracked stat values:
         SWARM will begin to start comparing the incoming
         stat with the last three. If the stat is 70% Higher
         or lower than one of the 3 previous stats- It is ignored.
       -This will create better Profit / Day averages.
       -This will ignore bs over-inflated stats.
         
       NOTE: If the super ultra-rare circumstance occurs- that the first three
       stats pulled by SWARM from pools were insanely high, or insanely
       low- I can't control the fact that it will ignore the next stats.
       Be advised that you should be careful to watch the very first 3
       runs when profit is cleared.

   -Switch Threshold
      -Now factors miners with previous coins, even if that coin was
       not pulled.

   NEW FEATURES!

   -Miner Downloads have been re-done. Very much improved:
      -SWARM now self-determines the compression type.
      -SWARM will run the correct decompression software.
      -SWARM will determine the correct file path of the exectuable
       and other files. This includes compression not originally
       packaged in a folder, or folders that had different names
       than the name of the compression file.
      -I removed previous code for dpkg files and ergo excavator miner.

    -Version update no longer has ridiculous rules to use.
       -If a miner has a direct download (megashared and google download won't work).
       -Use that link.
       -Done.

    -If Wallet1 is not specifed, miner will shut down.
      * Because of this, if you use -Wallet1 as your last
        argument, you will be able to tell if there is an
        issue with your arguments, such as spacing between them,
        etc.

    -StatsInterval argument will default to 1 if miners are benchmarking.

    -Because it confused users: -CoinExchange will show profit / day of coin
     of you own choosing (can use BTC). This will NOT calculate power draw.
     Only Miner Fees & Current Profit.

     Note: There is one item unaddressed with the system, that is Switching_Threshold-
       Switching_Threshold argument works fine with algorithms. However, coins, which
       are piped into database only when they are profitable- Creates a scenario in
       which the current coin you are mining may not be added to the database next pull.
       This means the Switching_Threshold will not be applied to it.
       I am working on a solution, but this one will take time.


   2.2.1

  Note: Windows users. It is advised to rocket launch arguments after update. This
  is because parameters have changed!

  -Stats were removed of potential compounding of figures due to modifiers, should
   be closer to realistic when -Volume "yes" is used.

  -No_Miner was removed
  -All No_Algo arguments was removed.

  ``-Xnsub [Yes/No] now added for extranonce.subscribe method. Default is no.``

  ``-Bans`` argument now added! Allows user to specify in depth
    prohibitions from algorithms from anywhere to pools to specific
    devices. See help.txt for usage.

    ``Bans`` command added. Allow users to permenantly adjust config\pool
      .json to add bans to miners. Can be ran remotely. It works exactly 
      like ``-Bans`` argument, only that the changes are permanent until removed
      unles ``-Bans`` argument, which is temporary to instance of current running
      SWARM.

      ``bans add c11:zergpool,sonoa:z-enemy1,grincuckatoo31:NVIDIA2,RVN:zpool``
      ``bans remove c11:zergpool,sonoa:z-enemy1,grincuckatoo31:NVIDIA2,RVN:zpool``

  ``-Coin`` argument can accept multiple coins! Can be used to mine a finite
     set of coins of your choosing. Note: This is expiremental. Please report
     issues.

    ``-Coin RVN,VEIL,GIN,XZC -Algorithm x16r,VEIL,x16rt,mtp -Auto_Coin Yes -Auto_Algo No``
                Will mine only those coins on pools that support coinpools.

    ``-Coin RVN,VEIL,GIN,XZC -Algorithm x16r,VEIL,x16rt,mtp -Auto_Coin Yes -Auto_Algo Yes``
              Will mine those coins on coinpools, and will mine algorithms on algo pools

     Again, this is expirimental, please let me know if you try and have issues.

  -Issues with zpool coin and algo files were fixed.
  -Switching_Threshold should now add previously mined coins to database.
  -Colors was removed at the end of launch in h-run.sh, it is depreciated.
  -.git information will no longer be added to release- It was causing extraction issues.
  -Updated parameter parsing on windows side to prevent potenial issues.
  -ASIC_ALGO should add to pool-algos.json, so you can ban coins remotely.
  -``view`` command has changed to ``nview`` to prevent conflict with ``mc``
  -Attempted fix of -GPUDevices argumetns when 0 is specified. It appears to work for me.
  -Miner fixes to ``Write-Log`` function users pointed out.
  -bans.json added, for global bans. Will only be created when used.
  -Cleaned up some API methods.



     2.2.2

  -Updated TeamRedMiner
  -Updated Gminer

  Small Fixes:

  -Fixed Global ``-Bans`` #118
  -Fixed Zpool with -Coin argument.

  -SWARM can now handle tar.xz links.
  -Attempted fix of error when Switching_Threshold
   is applied to a miner that is benchmarking. #117

  Note: Update will not transfer pool-algos.json this release
        This means you must add bans again, if done through
        command.
