Changelog

  2.3.9

  NEW FEATURES!

  SMOS Support:

  https://github.com/MaynardMiner/SWARM/wiki/SMOS-Install

  -Fixed Log Cylcing Issues.
  -Windows: Fixed Bus Sorting of GPUs.
  -Fixed ``version update`` command
  -Fixed ``get parameters`` command for Windows (was showing arguments.json always).

  -Notification Miner Port is being cleared on screen (linux).
  * SWARM will wait until miner port is cleared (indefinitely, if such is the case,
   notifying user there is issue with rig).
  * I am doing this, because there is a growing issue with latest miners having
    ports hang in linux- This is developer issues of miners themselves. 
    This way can go to developers and let them know their miners won't 
    close ports properly on exit.

  -T-Rex updated
  -TeamRedMiner updated, x16 algos added.
  -xmrig amd updated
  -xmrig nvidia updated (windows, need to compile for linux still).
  -xmrstak updated.

  -Added more to ``vars`` parameter for modules.
  -Wiki was updated.


  2.4.0

  Note- This is beta version from beta_testing branch

   GUIDED HELP
   * There are four different ways to start guided help:
     * run command ``swarm_help`` after SWARM has started in HiveOS/Windows
     * [Linux] Run sudo ./help.sh (will install SWARM first, then run help)
     * [Windows] Run Help.bat
     * [ALL] opening either SWARM.bat or ./swarm, and adding ``-help``
   * Will allow users to set up a basic configuration
   * After basic config is created, will allow users to modify advanced settings.
   * Everything is guided, and additional information beyond help.txt is supplied.
   * Guided help will save your configuration to newarguments.json, as well as
     provide a copy/paste of arguments for flighsheets/configs.

    NEW ARGUMENTS!

  ``-TypeBanCount``

  Like PoolBanCount,MinerBanCount, and AlgoBanCount, TypeBanCount will take
  action if a device type (AMD1,CPU,NVIDIA1,etc.) has x consecutive banned
  miners in a row- Where x is -TypeBanCount. When x has been reached, SWARM
  will reset all timeouts, then restart computer.

  ``-TCP_IP``
   Default is 127.0.0.1. Sets IP for tcp api.

   -NEW FEATURES!

  -Removed CoreInfo for AES detection
  -Better GPU detection (windows)
   * Lists Correct VRAM
   * AMD lists vbios version
   * AMD lists memory vendor

  -Fixed issue if more than one active logfile was present

  -Code staging for a guided step-by-step tutorial to set up SWARM.

  -SWARM should display a message is a miner was skipped over due to ``-threshold``

  -Per user request- Removed FancyIX's suggest settings for mtp (-p 0,strict,verbose,d=700)

  -Test-Path HiveOS oc log first to prevent error generation

  -``get active screen`` displays differently
   * removed "Days", as it wasn't needed.
   * added "#", which is the instance number
   * ordered by instance- Greatest (most recently ran miners) to least.

  -Improved CPU metrics (Windows)

  -TCP api now shows "WorkerName"

  -fixed html api (I didn't notice I broke it. It is restored).

  -There was a rare issue in windows when the background script controlloing active miner
   would crash. This would result in the SWARM launching a new miner while
   the active miner continued to run. When SWARM restarts/closes miners, it will now
   close all child process associated with that starting script. This includes if users added 
   pre-starting scripts. Linux - The screen window is closes, meaning all processes in that 
   screen are closed with it...Hence it is not needed.

  -Windows: It is common that if a miner card has crashed, the miner window will not close.
   if user specifies ``-Startup Yes`` (Default is Yes), SWARM will restart computer after
   2 minutes of the window staying open. It will notify HiveOS this is the case.

  -xmrig linux update
  -xmr-stak linux updated
  -cpuminer updated (note- avx2 only!!)
  -cc-mtp updated
  -nminer updated
  -teamredminer updated

     NEW FEATURES!

    -Windows: Hashrate Watchdog in HiveOS now works!
     * LA reboot is not working- coming soon.
    
    -Windows: Push Interval works on HiveOS.

    -Windows: GPU watchdog works on HiveOS.
     * If a GPU shows a temperature of 0,
       SWARM reboots computer

    -Windows: Miner Delay works on HiveOS.
     * SWARM starts, but goes to sleep.

    -HiveOS: Auto-Upgrade of pwsh to 6.2.0

    -SWARM will now save version of miner to
    swarm-version.txt in bin folder of miner.

    -if version in swarm-version.txt and update.json
     are a mismatch- SWARM will download miner to
     latest version.
    
    -Version checking is useuful for users cloning
     SWARM rather than downloading new version.
    
    -Wildrig updated
    -gminer updated

    FIXES

    -There was a bug with oc-tuning for SWARM that was causing it to not start.
     This version fixes.
     
    -Fixed culture info of datetime errors.

    -Windows 7/8: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6561
     fixed -wait parameter issues- Known powershell bug.
    
    -Windows ASIC: Prevent GPU-detection from running if only ASIC specified.

        -``version update`` commmand for Windows is now
      working again. Tested it repeatedly. It still
      works for linux. To use:

      ``version update [miner name] [version number] [download uri]``
       (Still must be a direct download, Mega will not work)

      If you are unsure of the denoted name SWARM uses for miner-
      use the ``version query`` command.

    -For All_Altwallets
     * Since your mining the coin directly, mc= / zap= is not needed .
     * SWARM will now remove the mc= / zap= .

    -``swarm_help`` in linux was glitching out during selection of
     advanced paramters- Fixed.


    # SWARM 2.4.4

    NOTE: Wallet.json has changed, because of this- your old wallets.json will
    not transfer on update. You will have to fill out new wallet.json.

    ## New features!
    * Windows: Added -Hive_Hash to Windows_Help.bat
    * SWARM will close miners before updating new version
     (mainly fixes windows "file is in use" potential error).
    * If user has nicehash as only pool- Donate pool becomes nicehash.
    * SWARM will remove optional miners when not specified.
    * Lyraz330 algorithm added
    * Windows: SWARM will show .json sent to HiveOS for stats.
    * NEW wallet.json
      * easier to understand.
      * allows solo mining settings.
      * allows auto-exchange settings with solo mining.
      * admin wallet settings added
      * note: As before- All arguments have a higher precedence.
        * If you set -Admin_fee, SWARM will ignore admin in .json
        * If you set -Altwallet1, SWARM will ignore all altwallet settings.
        * This is so you can remotely force "remove" settings if need be.

    ## NEW arguments!
    * ``-Admin_Fee``
        [0-50] Percentage
        Admin_Fee allows users to set a seperate wallet, and specify
        a certain percentage of time mined on that wallet a day. Admin
        Mode is done first, and then normal mode begins. Every 24 hours-
        Admin_Mode starts again, mining % of day specified by this parameter.
        If SWARM enters donation mode, time is either added to Admin_Fee, or
        removed, to encompass an even distribution between admin mode and user mode.
        Simple timestamp of when last Admin ran occurred will be
        placed in ".\admin" folder for reference. They will be transferred on update.
        ``-Admin`` must be specified if using ``-Admin_Fee``

    * ``-Admin``
        Admin Wallet for ``-Admin_Fee`` Parameter
    * ``-Admin_Pass`` Password symbol for ``-Admin``
        Default is "BTC"

    ## FIXES:
    * oc tuning between website and local is fixed- OC tuning can now
      interchange between website and local oc.
      * note: HiveOS can only do group 1 (AMD1/NVIDIA1)
      * SWARM can do all device groups, so you can combine both, but
        it will skip over group 1 if it is was done already through site.
      * You can set SWARM oc to use as a backup in case website oc fails.
        * At least the default oc, so you don't crash cards because web oc failed.
    * SWARM will stop miners before updating miner if new version
      is detected in update.json. This prevents access-denied errors.
    * Added internal parameters to $(vars) parameter for modules.
    * Fixed issues in which SWARM did not stats fans/temps/power in
      Windows version (HiveOS agent).
    * Weird parsing of wallets happening with -Coin argument. Was fixed.

    ## UPDATES:
    * Wildrig updated
    * cc-mtp updated
    * cpuminer updated
    * Lyraz330 added
    * t-rex updated
    * cc-mtp updated
    
    2.4.5

    ## FEATURES
    * Cleaned up repository, removed uncessary files.
    * All major variables for core program are now
      contained in $(vars) variable.
    * Add new functions to add/remove/check variables
      for modules (see swarm.ps1 for description).
    * SWARM will now try to 'guess' miner binary downloads,
      when the link doesn't end with the package name.
      * example: https://mybadassminer.com/download
        * SWARM will assume this is a .zip or 7z if windows.
        * SWARM will assume this is a tar.gz if linux.
    * ``version update`` command was edited so that
        links can contain special characters.
        * example: https://mybadassminer.com/&getdownloads_1=&download_8008135
          * The '&' would previously break ``version update`` command.
          * This works if you the url is between quotes (' ')
            example: ``version update cc-awesome 1.0.0 'https://mybadassminer.com/&getdownloads_1=&download_8008135'``
    * Remove certification checks for github, and some other sites- This may Help
      issues with users who's internet connection is not so great download miners.
        
    ## FIXES (from beta release)
    * When SWARM restarts loop (no miners! error, bad download, etc.), it
      will not remove all previous variables, preventing dictionary errors.
    * There was a typo for Windows AMD overclocking in beta version for
      core voltage - Fixed.
    * Reduced GPU Watchdog sensitivity from the first time it fails to displays
      temps, to 10 times in a row it must fail to display temps before restart.
    * Beta version- Coin miners would load, even when Auto_Coin wasn't specified:
      was resolved.
    * Beta version - Error output was missing in logs. This was fixed.

      * Shows number of timeouts on miner in past hour.
      * Clears count of bad benchmarks on miner after hour
        of it working fine.
      * Ban for Miner to HiveOS now shows Miner:Type.

    ## FIXES

  monitor downloading.
* typo in bminer on windows side- Added 'export LD_LIBRARY'
  from linux side, didn't cause any issues, but fixed
  to prevent error.

## Fixes
* Wallets.json full depth was not being covertedto-Json on update.
  This is resolved.
* Wallets.json "Add another coin here" was getting added on occasion
  to arguments as c=, causing certain miners to fail- This was resolved.

## Updates
* Wildrig_Multi (windows only release) 
  * glt-globalhash not added HiveOS yet. Did not add to SWARM.
    Very complicated to add one algorithm for Windows, but not Linux.
