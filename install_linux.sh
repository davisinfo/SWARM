#
# This will attempt to install libs for certain miners that may be required.
# This will also install the commands swarm uses to /usr/bin, so they can be
# called upon at any time from any terminal.
#
# HiveOS does this automatically. If this fails to install commands -
# They are very simple actions that can be done manually by reviewing
# install.ps1. 
# I tried to keep linux expressions in ./build/powershell/scripts/install.ps1 
# in case they need to be done manually rather than using powershell code.
